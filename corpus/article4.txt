Juan Sumulung Memorial Junior System E-School IDSystem is an ID System that aims to provide a way for the parents to monitor their children each time they leave the house to go to school. This system helps in innovating technology for the school. The system will accept student barcode ID details and determine the validity of their high school students who enter and exit the school premises. Additionally, the system can generate text messages that are sent to the parents every time a student enters or exits the school. It also generates e-mail reports of the total logs of the students. Documented reports can also be generated for printing purposes.
The system is managed by an administrator account that is able to create staff accounts, student details and overall control on the system. The system was developed using the Scrum Model. The methods used by the proponents involve research and feasibility analysis.
During development, the proponents and the client established constant communication for the acquisition of requirements and for the changes that were requested to fit the preferences of the client. All the results were interpreted in tables and figures.
The proponents were successful in achieving the objectives, following the required specifications that were discussed upon approval.
