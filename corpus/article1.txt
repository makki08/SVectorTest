The team uses the agile software development in the developing the project. Agile software development (ASD) is a methodology for the creative process tat anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of practicality into the delivery of the finished product. Agile software development focuses on keeping code simple, testing often, and delivering functional bits of the application as soon as they’re ready. The goal of ASD is to build upon small client-approved parts as the project progresses, as opposed to delivering one large application at the end of the project.
After a specific period of the, the Institute of Computer Engineers of the Philippines-Student Edition Portal comprised to specific services suggested by the organization.
The principal conclusion was that the group was able to meet the general and specific objectives of the study.
