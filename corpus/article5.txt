The primary purpose of this was to create a system of online Consolation to the group’s chosen company, Sese and Associates Law Office. It focused on the improvement on the method of consulting of the client to the company currently using the manual process. Instead of Microsoft Excel to use in order to record the case of the client it will be replaced by the modern type of consulting and that is the online-consulting. Consultancy system is an e – commerce function where a law firm allows client to consult about their legal case via their website. They can collaborate to the lawyers through the system allowing information to flow easily without a time consuming data input process. Through this system the company will be known for their high-end services to the client and it will also serve as record system for each client of the company.
